# Game of life for Pixel
Turn your Pixel badge into a living organism with Conway's game of life.
Just run the game and enjoy. Once a generation stops evolving, the game will reset
and change colour to start a new generation.

# Ideas
Ideas for upcoming versions: sound, ability to input initial state and iterate
through each evolution yourself. Also need to implement a better sleep method,
according to https://pixel.curious.supplies/docs/app-development/tips/
